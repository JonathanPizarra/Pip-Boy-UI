# Pip-Boy-UI
UI of Pip Boy 3000 Mark IV from Fallout 4 using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

The data used in stats are random while the others are from screenshots I have scoured from the internet as I am not familiar with its complete design.

I haven't played the game.

A project based on a web development course I took in Udemy.
